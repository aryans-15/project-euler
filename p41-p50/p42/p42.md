The $k$th triangular number is $T_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$. To check if some integer $n$ is triangular, we can solve the quadratic $n = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$. Rearranging gives $k^2 + k - 2n = 0$, and by quadratic formula, $k = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1+8n}}{2}$. It follows that $8n+1$ must be a perfect square. Thus, we simply compute each word value $v$ and check if $8v+1$ is a perfect square.
