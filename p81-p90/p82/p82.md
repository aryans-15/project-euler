We use DP, where $dp_i$ is the minimum cost to reach row $i$ in the current column. Let our $n$ x $n$ grid be $S$ and let $dp_i=S_{i,0} \text { for all } i$.

Then, for each column $j$, we perform three passes:

1. $dp_i = S_{i, j} + dp_i$

2. for i = 1 to n - 1: $dp_i = \min(dp_i, dp_{i-1}+S_{i,j})$

3. for i = n - 2 to 0: $dp_i = \min(dp_i, dp_{i+1}+S_{i,j})$

After processing all columns, our answer is $\min_{0 \leq i < N} dp_i$.
