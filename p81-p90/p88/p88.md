Take some $n$ and assume we factor it into $m$ factors $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_m$. Then $s_f = \sum_{i=1}^{m}f_i$ and $p_f = \prod_{i=1}^{m} f_i$. If we pad the $m$ factors with $w$ copies of 1 such that the total number of terms is $k = m + w$ and the sum of all $k$ terms is $n$, then $p_f = n = s_f + w$, so $w = n - s_f$, and then $k = n - s_f + m$.

From here, we can run a DFS over non-decreasing factor sequences, keeping track of our current product, sum, and number of factors used. We can compute $k$ and prune early whenever our product exceeds $2k_{max}$, where $k_{max} = 12000$ (an arbitrary yet reasonable upper bound).

We keep track of the best possible number for each $2 \leq k \leq 12000$, and after our DFS, our answer is the sum of said numbers.
