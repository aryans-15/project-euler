In an $m$ x $n$ grid, there are $m+1$ horizontal lines and $n+1$ vertical lines. To construct a rectangle, you need to choose two horizontal and two vertical lines, so it follows there are $\binom{m+1}{2}\binom{n+1}{2}=\frac{mn(m+1)(n+1)}{4}$ rectangles in the grid. We can now test all $m, n$ within a reasonable limit to find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.
