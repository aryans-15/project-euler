This is identical to [Problem 67](../../p61-p70/p67/p67.md).

Although brute force passes, we will use DP. Let our grid be $G$, and let $dp_{0, 0} = G_{0, 0}$. Then, for all $j > 0$, $dp_{i, j} = S_{i, j} + max(dp_{i-1, j-1}, dp_{i-1, j})$. Each value is only dependent on the possibilities directly above it, and our DP runs in $O(n^2)$. Furthermore, although unnecessary, we can optimize to $O(n)$ memory with a bottom-up DP if needed.
