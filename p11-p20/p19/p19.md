Since January 1st, 1900 was a Monday, it follows that January 1, 1901 was a Tuesday because there are 365 days in 1900 (not a leap year) and $365 \equiv 1 \mod 7$.

Once we have the starting day, we can loop through all years from 1901 to 2000 and update the starting day for each month, while also making sure to add an extra day for leap years whenever necessary.
