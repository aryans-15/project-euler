If the arrow starts at $(0, 0)$ and goes to $(-20, -20)$, the number of moves is fixed; we have to go down 20 times and right 20 times. Their order, however, is not fixed.

Encoding downs as $D$ and rights as $R$, the problem reduces to computing the number of ways to rearrange a string with 20 Ds and 20 Rs, which is $\binom{40}{20}$.
