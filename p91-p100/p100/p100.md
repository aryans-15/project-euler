We seek to find the minimal number of blue discs $b$ and total discs $n$ such that $n > 10^{12}$ and $\frac{b(b-1)}{n(n-1)} = \frac{1}{2}$. This rearranges to $2b(b-1) = n(n-1)$, and since this equation is quadratic in both variables, we can set up a linear recurrence to relate $b_{k+1}, n_{k+1}$ to $b_k, n_k$.

We know $(b_0, n_0) = (15, 21)$ and $(b_1, n_1) = (85, 120)$. From manual search, we can find $(b_2, n_2) = (493, 697)$, and we then get the following linear recurrence:

$b_{k+1} = 3b_k + 2n_k - 2\\$
$n_{k+1} = 4b_k + 3n_k - 3$

From here, we simply iterate until $n > 10^{12}$.
