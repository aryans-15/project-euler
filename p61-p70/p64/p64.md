We can compute the continued fraction of $\sqrt{n}$ with a recurrence. Let $(m_0, d_0, a_0) = (0, 1, \lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor)$, then for $k \geq 0, (m_{k+1}, d_{k+1}, a_{k+1}) = (d_ka_k - m_k, \frac{n - m_{k+1}^2}{d_k}, \lfloor\frac{a_0+m_{k+1}}{d_{k+1}}\rfloor)$. 

We repeat this process until we find a period. We do this over all $1 \leq n \leq 10000$ while keeping track of how many periods are odd.
