The fundamental solution of $x^2 - Dy^2$ for a non-square integer $D$ can always be found among the convergents of the continued-fraction expansion of $\sqrt{D}$.

To represent $\sqrt{D}$ as a continued fraction, we use the same recurrence as [Problem 64](../p64/p64.md). Each finite truncation of this continued fraction gives us a rational $\frac{h}{k}$. Letting $(h_{-2}, h_{-1}, k_{-2}, k_{-1}) = (1, a_0, 0, 1)$, these numerators and denominators obey the following recurrence:

$h_n = a_nh_{n-1} + h_{n-2}$

$k_n = a_nk_{n-1} + k_{n-2}$

For some $D$, once we find some $h, k$ such that $h^2 - Dk^2$ = 1, we are done. We do this over all $D \leq 1000$ and find the value for which the largest $x$ is obtained.
