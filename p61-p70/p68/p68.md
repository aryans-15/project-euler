We run a brute force, picking five numbers between 1 and 10 to sit on the outer nodes, and the other five on the inner nodes. To avoid duplicates from rotation, we fix the smallest outer node to appear first. Then, for each possibility, we check if the magic sums are equal, and if they are, we update our maximum lexicographic string.
