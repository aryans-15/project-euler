We never need to try any bases $b > 9$. This is because $10^n$ has $n + 1$ digits, which is clearly invalid. Therefore, it suffices to loop over all exponent values $e$ and try all bases $1 \leq b \leq 9$; if we can find at least one possible case where $b^e$ has $e$ digits, we continue to the next value of $e$, and otherwise, we break.
