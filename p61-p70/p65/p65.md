We generate the first 100 coefficients for the continued fraction of $e$. Let $a_i$ be the $i$th coefficient. We start by initializing a fraction $F = \frac{a_{99}}{1}$, and then let $F = a_i + \frac{1}{F}$ for each $a_i$ descending from $i = 98$ to $i = 0$. At the end of this, $F$ is the 100th convergent of $e$, so we can extract our numerator and print the sum of its digits.
