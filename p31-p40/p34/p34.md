The factorial of any digit is less than or equal to $9! = 362880$, thus, a number with k digits has a largest possible sum of $k * 9!$. Through some trial and error, we can observe that $k = 7$ is the largest possible value where $k * 9!$ does not have more than $k$ digits. It then suffices to loop through all integers between $10$ (since single-digit numbers are not sums) and $7 * 9! = 2540160$ inclusive.
