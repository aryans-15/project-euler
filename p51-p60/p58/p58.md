From [Problem 28](../../p21-p30/p28/p28.md), we know that for an $n$ x $n$ square, the top right number is $n^2$. The other numbers are then $n^2 - n + 1$, $n^2 - 2n + 2$, and $n^2 - 3n + 3$. Furthermore, for an $n$ x $n$ square, we know that $2n - 1$ numbers lie across both diagonals. 

With this info, we can maintain a prime counter $p$ and keep incrementing our square side length $l$ until $\frac{p}{2l-1} \leq \frac{1}{10}$. After each increment, we simply check the four new corners for primality.
