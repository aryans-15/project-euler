We start by computing $A$, the set of all abundant numbers less than 28124. Then, for each integer $i < 28124$, we check if there exists some $j \in A$ such that $i - j \in A$. If there does not exist any such $j$, then $i$ cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers, and we add it to a running total.
