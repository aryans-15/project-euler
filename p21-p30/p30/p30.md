The fifth power of any digit is less than or equal to $$9^5 = 59049$$, thus, a number with k digits has a largest possible sum of $$k * 9^5$$. Through some trial and error, we can observe that $$k = 6$$ is the largest possible value where $$k * 9^5$$ does not have more than $$k$$ digits. It then suffices to loop through all integers between $$10$$ (since single-digit numbers are not sums) and $$6 * 9^5 = 354294$$ inclusive.
