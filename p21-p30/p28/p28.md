Writing out the first few squares by hand, we find the following:
- a $1$ x $1$ square has contribution $1$.
- a $3$ x $3$ square adds contribution $3, 5, 7, 9$.
- a $5$ x $5$ square adds contribution $13, 17, 21, 25$.
- a $7$ x $7$ square adds contribution $31, 37, 43, 49$.

We notice the numbers on the top right diagonal are perfect squares; for an $n$ x $n$ square, the top right number is $n^2$. The other numbers are then $n^2 - n + 1$, $n^2 - 2n + 2$, and $n^2 - 3n + 3$.

We can then compute the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in $O(L)$ for a given side length $L$ by looping through all $n \leq \frac{L+1}{2}$.
