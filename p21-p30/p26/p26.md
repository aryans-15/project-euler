The length of the recurring cycle of $$\frac{1}{d}$$ is the smallest integer $$k$$ such that $$10^k \equiv 1 \pmod{d}$$. This is known as the multiplicative order of $$10 \mod d$$ (provided $$\gcd(d, 10) = 1$$). 

For each integer, we keep track of $$10^k \mod d$$; once a remainder repeats, we've entered a cycle and can easily calculate its length. However, we also need to check if the remainder ever becomes zero; in this case, the decimal has terminated.
