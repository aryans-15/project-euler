Primitive Pythagorean triples are triplets where $\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$ and $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. We can generate them with the following: $(a, b, c) = (m^2-n^2, 2mn, m^2+n^2)$ where $m > n$, $m - n$ is odd, and $gcd(m, n) = 1$.

Let the perimeter of a primitive Pythagorean triangle be $p$. Then $p = a + b + c = 2m^2 + 2mn$. It follows that non-primitive triples are simply multiples of primitive ones, meaning that if $p$ is a primitive perimeter, then $kp$ is a valid perimeter of a non-primitive Pythagorean triple.

These facts follow from [Euclid's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple#Generating_a_triple), and we can use it to generate primitive Pythagorean triples. We can add these triples and all their multiples under 1,500,000 to a count array; our answer is then the number of entries in this array with a count of 1.
