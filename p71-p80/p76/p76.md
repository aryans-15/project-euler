This is the classic integer partition problem (with the exception that we cannot include the number itself as a possible partition). We can use DP, letting $dp_i$ be the number of integer partitions for $i$. Let $dp_0 = 1$, then $dp_j$ = $\sum_{j=1}^{i}dp_{i-j}$. It follows our answer is $dp_{100} - 1$ (since we have to subtract the partition of 100 itself).
