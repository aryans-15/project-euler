This is a variation of the coin change problem, where our coins are primes. Define $dp_i$ to be the number of ways to write $i$ as a sum of primes and let $dp_0 = 1$, then $dp_i = \sum_{\substack{p \leq i \\ p \text{ prime}}} dp_{i - p}$. It suffices to run a brute force on $n$ and keep recomputing the DP array until $dp_n > 5000$.
