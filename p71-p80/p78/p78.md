Clearly, $p(n)$ is the number of ways to partition the integer $n$ into sums of positive integers. Then $p(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} p(n-k)$. This is too slow, so we can use [Euler's pentagonal number theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number_theorem) to optimize, which states that $p(n) = \sum_{k \neq 0}(-1)^{k-1}p(n-g_k)$ for $g_k = \frac{k(3k-1)}{2}$. We can then cache $p(n)$ and brute force until we find the first $n$ where $p(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{10^6}$.
