For a fraction to be reduced and proper, it must be in the form $\frac{n}{d}$ where $n < d \text{ and } \gcd(n, d) = 1$. This is a direct application of [Euler's totient function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function) $\phi(n)$, which calculates the number of integers $k$ in the range $1 \leq k \leq n$ such that $gcd(n, k) = 1$. It follows our answer is $\sum_{2 \leq i \leq 1000000} \phi(n)$; we start at $i = 2$ to ignore the case where $(n, d) = (1, 1)$. 

We can use a sieve to compute this quantity fast.
